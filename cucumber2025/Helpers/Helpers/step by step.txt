find out what steps are already in @BeforeClass hooks in Runner 
Add the test Scenario ( test cases with steps)
Create step definition , add logger, Copy paste unimplemented methods.
Create page object model.(contains only action methods and variables. sometimes returns booleans) 
after adding more loggers and action methods, 
we do Softassertions at the end of the stepD method 
we do debug and confirm that everything is working fine. ( avoid built in code blocks . step return) 
check assertion failure is working or not.
